# parcel-react-quick-setup

This code is a boilplate setup for react using parcel. 

I tried to set up it up similar to the structure of create-react-app. 

I find it runs a bit quicker and is a little more simple in nature. 

## Usage 

git clone this repo. and run `npm install`

to start up parcel `npm start`

this will start a server on localhost port1234

to run tests run `npm test`

to create a production ready build run `npm run build`
